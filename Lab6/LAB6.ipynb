rispetto alla rete deterministica)\r\n","* Dopodiché abbiamo testato la rete **con dropout attivo** : dropout at inference time. Non so se sia corretto, ora indago (a me interessa dropout attivo solo se voglio calcolare l'incertezza. Ad ogni modo anche lui ha fatto così)\r\n","* Infine abbiamo ripetuto il test per MC volte, per ogni sample, e per ogni sample abbiamo calcolato la sua incertezza rispetto alla label che gli abbiamo assegnato\r\n","* Usando le predizioni e i valori di incertezza, abbiamo comparato i valori di incertezza per le previsioni corrette e quelle errate, ottenendo, inaspettatamente, un andamento pressoché identico (cosi come gia successo la prima volta che ho fatto LAB 6).\r\n","\r\n","Una possibile spiegazione è dovuta al fatto che la rete non è in grado di classificare bene i samples, a prescindere dal fatto che la classificazione sia corretta o meno, perché le features fornite non sono sufficienti: in questo senso, tutti i sample risultano \"difficili\""]}]}
